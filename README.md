## FundiDesk

If you ever visit the kariakoo market in Tanzania, you must have met "Fundi Simu" who repairs phones for the local people. Most fundis

## Problems
- Space: Fundis love to cluster, and everyone needs power supply, umbrella and other stuff, so that sometimes the space may get very crowded.
- Storage: Fundis put everything on the top of the desk, which is messay and unorganized.


## Our Design

We designed a interier side containter and a connector for the fundi desk.

### Rapid Prototyping

We used OnShape to design the 3D model, and 3D priting to print the prototype [prototype](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/770dbdb6e5e5786d75164041/w/601f35e9fa386c2315229862/e/ac914ba21baa19614e4c4a59). You can find the STL file here and 3D print it yourself `fundidesk.stl`
